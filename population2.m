function Y = population2(n)
% n = population size

% It is noted that the number of bits to represent the variables in binary
% numbers depends on the required accuracy (the number of difits after
% comma)

% In this example, I want the solution precision with 5 places after the
% decimal point, and with the upper and lower bounds of the variables are 3
% and -3, so , for each variable, we need 20 bits.
% General formula: 2^(m-1) < (upper bound - lower bound)*10^p < 2^m-1
% In this case: p = 5 and m = 20.
% We have 2 variables (x and y), so we need 40 bits in total for binary
% encoding.
Y=round(rand(n,40));
